    <p>Control systems engineering loves it’s transformations, and they can be quite overwhelming to get a hold of. And sort-of complicated too. With these series of posts, I will try to simplify and streamline the theory. The math, especially.</p>
    <p>Let’s lay out a brief overview first.</p>
    <h2>The Time-Domain</h2>
    <p>In the real world, we have continuous-time systems. These process and generate signals continuously without any interval or wait times. For example, a DC motor. Turn on the supply and it will continuously process the applied voltage and generate a continuous torque. A <strong>continuous-time</strong> system or signal is also known as an <strong>analog</strong> system or signal.</p>
    <p>And oh right, </p>
    <p>Signal: A single-valued function of one or more variables, that holds or conveys some information</p>
    <p>System: An entity which acts on (one or more) inputs or some excitation to produce (one or more) outputs, according to some rule. This rule defines the system.</p>
    <h2>The frequency domain</h2>
    <p>A continuous-time input, is a combination of multiple frequencies and so can be the output, practically speaking.</p>
    <p>The system itself, responds differently to each frequency that passes through it. To figure out this frequency profile, we take the <strong>Fourier Transform</strong> of this input signal. If it’s a <strong>periodic</strong> signal, a <strong>Fourier Series expansion</strong> is used. </p>
    <p>We also do the same for the system, to figure out it’s <strong>frequency response</strong> (how it changes the amplitude and phase of incoming signals with different frequencies).</p>
    <h2>The complex frequency domain (s-domain)</h2>
    <p>A real world system is expressed through differential equations, made up of derivatives with respect to the <strong>continuous-time</strong> variable, $t$. Differential equations are hard to solve. We pass these through the <strong>Laplace Transform</strong> to convert them into algebraic equations (of a <strong>complex</strong> variable - $s$). These equations in the so-called $s$-domain, are easier to solve due to their algebraic nature.  </p>
    <p>We plot the solutions to the differential equations in the time-domain - on a plane where the x-axis represents $t$. We can see how the system output changes over time, and that’s it. Kind of like watching grass grow. We can’t see through the system, and get insights about it’s control-related behaviour (not conveniently, at least).</p>
    <p>After taking the Laplace Transform of the differential equations, we enter the $s$-domain, and here we only plot the poles and zeros of the system, but we get a lot more information about the system behavior and stability. We can <em>visualise the changes we need to make</em> to the input and the system to get that desirable output.</p>
    <p>We do all of this on our notebooks<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and feel smart about it, but then, to implement our designed control system, we would very clearly need a computer - a micro-controller, which is a <strong>digital system</strong>. We could always use pneumatic actuators, bimetallic strips, etc. to make a mechanical control system. Actually that would be quite cool. Never mind, even the digital implementation is hard as it is, at least for me. I digress.</p>
    <h2>The discrete-time domain</h2>
    <p>Digital systems cannot deal with continuous values. A computer reads an instruction and executes it, according to a predefined instruction set architecture<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Then it reads another and then another and it continues to operate this way. It’s a system that inherently operates sequentially. </p>
    <p>And so, it will read it’s inputs (for e.g., sensor values<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>), sequentially. It’ll accept one, process it, and then take the next one, (which might already be stored in a storage buffer). There’s an interval, a gap between the reception and processing of an individual input value or “sample”. If the real continuous-time signal will change during that interval, that change will be lost.</p>
    <p>A digital system cannot exist in a state where it is just absorbing the external inputs, in continuous time. Best it can do is try to take these input values very quickly, with very little interval between them so it can construct the continuous-time signal as closely as possible, but there will always be missed information. This process of reading inputs at fixed time intervals is called <strong>sampling</strong>. </p>
    <p>We sample a continuous-time signal and get a <strong>discrete-time</strong> signal. Continuous-time signals are represented through differential equations, and discrete-time signals are represented through <strong>difference equations</strong>. These difference equations, are in the discrete time-domain - it is the set of all integers $\Z$, or any of it’s countable subset. On the other hand, a continuous-time domain is the set of all real numbers $\reals$, or some uncountable (infinite) subset of it. </p>
    <p>The solution to a difference equation is also not all that interesting, that grass all over again. So we came up with a discrete-time equivalent of the Laplace Transform - the <strong>$\text{Z}-$Transform</strong>. It helps us analyse the system stability, transient behaviour and design controllers with more insight, in the discrete-time domain.</p>
    <h2>The digital domain</h2>
    <p>There’s yet another layer to unwrap. A discrete-time signal is just that, discrete <strong>in time</strong>. But it’s amplitude is continuous - it can take values from an infinite set of values. </p>
    <p>When we sample the amplitudes of a discrete-time signal, we get a <strong>digital signal</strong>. It’s not called sampling however, it’s called <strong>quantization</strong> - a set of discrete amplitude levels is defined<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and the continuous amplitude values are rounded off to the nearest value available in that set of discrete amplitude values.</p>
    <p>A digital signal is discrete in both time and amplitude<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. A $z$-transform can still very well be applied to it, as digital signals are technically a subset of all discrete-time signals. Digital signal processing (DSP) utilizes $z$-transforms a lot.</p>
    <p>Another thing I would like to add is, a discrete-time signal or a digital signal is just a large sequence (or list) of numbers. A list of paired numbers, like key-value pairs, where each time-step (sample) has an amplitude (level) associated with it. You could very well store a discrete-time signal in an excel sheet. </p>
    <p>And, that’s it! We now have a certain high-level idea of what is used where. In upcoming posts, we shall delve deeply into each of these topics.  </p>
    <p>Here’s a visual aid,</p>
    <p><img alt="transphobia-aid.png" src="/assets/img/transphobia-aid.webp"/></p>
    <p>Bonus: We can also get the discrete-time version of the Fourier Transform, called the, well, Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), by setting the magnitude of the $z$ variable in the $z$-transform to 1. More on this in the upcoming posts. Hopefully.</p>

    <p>Continuous-time control development is actually very important, as we’ll see soon - and there are plenty of software packages available to do that - MATLAB, Octave, Scilab, etc. to name a few.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:2">
    <p>This is also the definition of a Turing machine&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

    <p>We interface a digital system’s inputs and outputs through sensors and actuators, that are connected to the several GPIO, ADC, DAC ports, etc. available on it.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

    <p>The “gap” between these quantisation levels, depends on the resolution of the digital system, i.e. how many bits we are using to define these levels - more bits, imply higher resolution.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:5">
    <p>There’s another step in this conversion “analog-to-digital” conversion. A more text-book correct version of a digital signal has it’s discrete amplitude values encoded to a digital number representation (e.g. binary code, etc.), so that the time-amplitude pairs can be stored, processed and transmitted by the the digital hardware.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
